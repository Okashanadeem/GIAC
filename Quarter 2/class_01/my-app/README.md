# Class Overview

In this class, we created our first Next.js project. To start, we ran the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest .
npm run dev
```

### What I've Learned So Far:

#### 1. **React vs. Next.js**:
- **React**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A framework built on top of React that adds features like server-side rendering and routing.

#### 2. **Library vs. Framework**:
- **Library**: Helps with specific tasks, giving developers more freedom (React).
- **Framework**: Provides a full structure and set of rules to follow (Next.js).

#### 3. **Creating a New Repo on GitHub Desktop**:
- We learned how to create a new repo on GitHub Desktop directly.

#### 4. **Parent and Child Components**:
- Components can have parent-child relationships, where the parent passes data (props) to the child.

#### 5. **Next.js Project Structure**:
- **layout/**: main view point of webpage.
- **pages/**: Contains the app's pages.
- **public/**: Stores static files like images.
- **components/**: Reusable parts of the UI.
- **styles/**: CSS files for styling.
